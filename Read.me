1. Differences in Selecting Elements
The main difference lies in how you target the elements and what the method returns to you.

2. Creating and Inserting a New Element
It’s a three-step process: Create it, Configure it (add text or classes), and Append it to the DOM.

3. What is Event Bubbling?
Think of it like a bubble rising in a glass of soda. When an event (like a click) happens on an element, it doesn't just stay there. It "bubbles up" to its parent, then the grandparent, all the way up to the document.

How it works: If you click a button inside a <div>, the click event fires on the button first, then the <div> "feels" the click, and finally the <body> feels it too.

4. What is Event Delegation?
Instead of adding an event listener to every single button or list item, you add one single listener to the parent.

Why it’s useful:

Memory Efficiency: One listener uses less memory than a hundred.

Dynamic Elements: If you add a new list item via JavaScript later, the parent's listener will automatically handle it without you needing to manually attach a new event to the new item.

5. preventDefault() vs. stopPropagation()
These two are often confused, but they do very different things:

preventDefault(): Stops the browser’s default behavior. For example, it prevents a link from opening a URL or a form from refreshing the page when you click "Submit."

stopPropagation(): Stops the Event Bubbling mentioned in Question 3. It prevents the event from traveling up to parent elements.
