1. What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

getElementById: This is the most specific one. It looks for one unique element using its ID. Since IDs should be unique in a document, it always returns just one single element.
getElementsByClassName: This searches for all elements that have a specific class name. It returns an "HTMLCollection," which is basically a list of all the matches it found.
querySelector: This is like a Swiss Army knife. You can use CSS-style selectors (like .my-class, #my-id, or div > p). It only returns the first match it finds.
querySelectorAll: This works exactly like querySelector, but instead of stopping at the first match, it finds all matching elements and puts them into a "NodeList".



2. How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?
It’s usually a two-step process:
Create it: You use document.createElement('tag_name'). For example, const newDiv = document.createElement('div'); creates a div in memory but not yet on the page.
Insert it: You have to tell the browser where to put it. You pick a parent element and use appendChild() to put it at the end, or prepend() to put it at the beginning. Example: document.body.appendChild(newDiv);.



3. What is Event Bubbling? And how does it work?
Event Bubbling is how events move up through the DOM tree. Imagine you have a button inside a div. If you click that button, the click "bubbles up".
How it works: First, the click triggers on the button itself. Then, it triggers on the div that holds the button, then the body, and finally the window. It’s like a ripple in water moving outward from the center.


4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
Instead of adding an event listener to every single child element (like 50 different <li> tags), you add one single listener to their common parent.
Why it's useful: It saves a lot of memory because you aren't creating dozens of functions. It’s also great for dynamic content—if you add a new list item later, you don't need to manually add a new listener to it; the parent is already watching for clicks on its children.



5. What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?
preventDefault(): This stops the default behavior of an element. For instance, if you click a submit button in a form, the page usually reloads. preventDefault() stops that reload so you can handle the data with JS.
stopPropagation(): This stops Event Bubbling. If you click a child element and you don't want the parent's click event to fire as well, you use stopPropagation() to cut the event off right there.
